<h1>THE FRONT END PHILOSOPHERS<h1>

This is a JavaScript front end and Rails back end school project for Flatiron School. This app is a studying aid and it helps you organize Philosophers under Branches and add some quick notes. 

I USED THE STANFORD ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHILOSOPHY and WIKIPEDIA for most of my seed data because I am not planning on launching this app in production mode. 
SO THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY BELONGS TO THEM. 
Use it only locally, or please create your own seed data for it. 

INSTRUCTIONS:
